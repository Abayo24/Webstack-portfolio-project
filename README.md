Project name: Teens Coding Hub
Welcome to Teens Coding Hub – a platform designed to support and guide tech beginners on their journey into the world of coding and technology. This project is a personal mission born from our own story, one of uncertainty, struggle, and, eventually, discovery.
Story behind creating this app- Like so many others, We found ourselves at crossroads when we first became interested in technology. We were fascinated but also overwhelmed by the complexity of it all, unsure where to start, and often felt stranded. The tech world can seem vast and intimidating, especially when you hear daunting talk about how hard and demanding it can be. For a long time, we hesitated, unsure of our own capabilities and intimidated by what lay ahead. That changed when we discovered ALX, a program that finally gave us a sense of direction and structure. With guidance and support, we began to see technology as something approachable and achievable, not a mountain too high to climb. 
Project Purpose- We created Teens Coding Hub to provide that same sense of direction to others who may be feeling stranded or intimidated, like we once were. This app is here to offer a gentle introduction, resources, and a supportive starting point for anyone interested in stepping into the tech field. We want to make it easier for others to find their path, to help them see that learning tech doesn’t have to be overwhelming or isolating. It’s our hope that this project becomes a beacon for all newcomers, guiding them on their first steps toward becoming part of our growing community in technology.
What This Project Offers- Through Teens Coding Hub, we aim to:
      1. Break down initial barriers that beginners face.
      2. Provide curated resources and direction on where to start.
      3. Create a space where new learners feel encouraged, informed, and ready to take the first step
